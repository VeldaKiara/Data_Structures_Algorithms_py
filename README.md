### Stack

The stack data structure allows us to place any programming artifact, variable or object on it.<br>
Its almost similar to a physical stack.

#### Stack Operations
Push<br>
- Used to insert elements to a stack<br>
- After pushing an element to a stack the new element becomes the top element.

Pop<br>
- Used to remove elements from a stack.<br>
- Uses First-in Last-out property, which means the top element , the last to be inserted is removed when the pop operation takes place.<br>

NB: Pop and push are the most fundamental operations to be used in stacks.

Peek<br>
- Used to return the top element.<br>
- Helps to check whether the stack is empty or other things that may come up.
